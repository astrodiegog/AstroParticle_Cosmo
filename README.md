# AstroParticle_Cosmo

During my second year at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I took Particle Astrophysics & Cosmology (ASTR 224), lectured by Professor Wolfgang Altmannshofer. This class reminds me a lot of The Physics of the Dark Universe course I took at UChicago taught by Professor Gordan Krnjaic, which got me extremely interested in astrophysics and cosmology. The class at Santa Cruz was lectured over Professor Dan Hooper's Particle Cosmology & Astrophysics textbook. In the future, I would like to write some latex notes. In the meantime, the goal of this repository is to reproduce some plots that I found particularly exciting.

The current goal is to reproduce the following plots:

1. Figure 4.1 - The number of relativistic degrees of freedom
2. Figure 5.1 - The differential cross section for inverse Compton scattering
3. Figure 6.1 - Hydrogen ionization fraction
